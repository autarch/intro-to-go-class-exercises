/*

For this exercise, you'll start with the code you just created for exercise
#5. You can paste it in below.

The goal of this exercise is to turn your User type into an OO type.

You already have a constructor, NewUser().

Change the PasswordIsValid() function to a method that takes a User struct as
the receiver.

Add two new methods. The Username() method should return the username of the
user it is called on (as the username type, not a string).

The SetUsername() method should accept a *string* and set the username of the
user.

(Yes, I know I just ranted about the evils of mutable state not more than a
few minutes ago, but I want you to know how to do these things, even if you
shouldn't do them often!)
